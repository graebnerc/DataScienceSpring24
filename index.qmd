title: "Data science using R"

# ðŸ“‘ The course in brief

**Focus:** 
You will be introduced to the statistical programming language R and acquire 
practical knowledge about the fundamental tools of data science and machine 
learning. 

**How:** 
The course comprises a mixture of (i) lectures, in which I introduce concepts
in the classroom, (ii) automated hands-on exercises for you to do at home on
your own and (iii) flipped-classroom elements where you watch videos at home
and we practice the content together in class.

**Prerequisites:**
The course does not require you to have any prior knowledge in R or any other 
programming language. Depending on your prior knowledge or affinity to 
programming, the course will be quite demanding, but equip you with 
computational skills that are most valuable both within academia and the 
business world.
