Please make sure to check out the most recent version of the seminar timetable 
since lecture dates might differ from one week to another. 
The most recent version can be found [here](/2024Spring/material/timetable.qmd).

# 💻 Exercises

There is an R package with interactive exercises for this course.
I strongly recommend to do the exercises for each session since regular 
practice is the most important determinant in your success in learning R.
You find more information on how to use the exercises in 
[this tutorial](/2024Spring/tutorials/using-exercises/).
On top of that, there are some additional exercises on selected topics
[here](/2024Spring/exercises.qmd).

# 📂 Material

You find an overview about all lecture materials, such as slides and
reading lists [here](/2024Spring/material/).
Complete material lists for the single sessions are distributed via the 
respective session pages.
Lecture videos can, so far, only be accessed via Moodle. EUF students can
register in the respective Moodle course using the password `DataScience24`.

# 📖 Tutorials

Complementary to the lectures there are also short tutorials, 
which explain certain concepts in a more detailed and applied manner.
You can find an overview over all tutorials [here](/2024Spring/tutorials.qmd).
