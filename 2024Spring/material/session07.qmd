This is one of the most underestimated topics. In this session you learn how
to adequately set up your working environment on your computer. This means
where you should save which files, which directory structure you should use,
and how to point the computer to other files on your computer. In this context
you also learn how to import data obtained elsewhere into R. While this sounds
boring at first, taking seriously the insights from this session will save you
tons of hours of frustration in the future!

More precisely, I can recommend the following:
