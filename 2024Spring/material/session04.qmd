In this video-based lecture you learn about the most important advanced
object types in R. The two object types covered in this lecture, factors and
data frames, are advanced in the sense that they can be thought of extensions
of some of the basic object types you encountered before: factors and special
kinds of integers, and data frames are special kinds of lists. This lecture
concludes the first part of the lecture about the basics of R.
